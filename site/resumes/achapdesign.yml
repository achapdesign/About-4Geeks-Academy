    summary: |
      I have several years in the automotive repair industry, I started in a vocational high school in the greater Boston area. Then I continued my automotive education at Universal Technical
      Institute, and carried on to the Volvo SAFE program. once I graduated, I was hired into Volvo Cars of Norwood where I worked 1 year and a half, then my manager moved to Boston Volvo Cars
      and he hired my there. Then to Volvo Cars Natick until the pandemic hit and my parents put me and my brother on the last flight to Portugal and we've been here ever since.

      I am a highly motivated individual with a proven ability to learn quickly, create, implement, and maintain procedures both old and new in any environment. I further possess the ability 
      to meet heavy work assignments and deadlines under strict time constraints. In addition to my strong commitment and desire to succeed in every assigned task, I am able to work independently
      or as a team, with a unique ability to communicate effectively on all levels.
